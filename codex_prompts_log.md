## Prompts

**Prompt 1:**
before we begin, I am working on assignment for my prompt engineering class. I have converstation logs and prompts logs for every llm I have interacted with in this repo. We need to make one for the logs we need for this codex session. Please create a "codex_conersation_log.md" and a "codex_prompts_log.md" file for our conversation and my user prompts respectively.

---

**Prompt 2:**
Generate a file named AGENTS.md that serves as a contributor guide for this repository.
Your goal is to produce a clear, concise, and well-structured document with descriptive headings and actionable explanations for each section.
Follow the outline below, but adapt as needed — add sections if relevant, and omit those that do not apply to this project.

Document Requirements

- Title the document "Repository Guidelines".
- Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) for structure.
- Keep the document concise. 200-400 words is optimal.
- Keep explanations short, direct, and specific to this repository.
- Provide examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns).
- Maintain a professional, instructional tone.

Recommended Sections

Project Structure & Module Organization

- Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located.

Build, Test, and Development Commands

- List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build).
- Briefly explain what each command does.

Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns.
- Include any formatting or linting tools used.

Testing Guidelines

- Identify testing frameworks and coverage requirements.
- State test naming conventions and how to run tests.

**Prompt 3:**
Look at CLAUDE.md , conversation_log.md , and lastSemest_eD_Notes.txt as reference to what this projet is and what the expectations are and update AGENTS.md accordingly.

---

**Prompt 4:**
This assignment is for my Prompt Engineering course in an information studies program. I am an archives student and not a data science student so I don't have training in statistical analysis or multiple linear regression. I have worked with Claude Code up through step 3 as outlined in eD.qmd . My submission document is eD_submission_main.qmd . Will you look through my submission document and check claude's work? Do not make any edits, rather tell me your feedback here.

**Prompt 5:**
I have not attempted step 4 yet. I'm trying to finalize steps 1-3 first.
I have not attempted the conclusion yet. Only focusing on steps 1-3 right now
Offer suggestions on how we can improve our justifications.
The instructor confirmed he will accept python
I have not attempted step 4 or the conclusion yet. Only focues on steps 1-3.

Please review steps 1-3 and offer your suggestions on how we can make our analysis, models, and explanations better. Review lastSemest_eD_Notes.txt as a reference to what the professor expects. Make sure the models are following Multiple Linear Regression best practices and offer suggestions on how we can improve. Do not edit the file, rather offer your feedback here. Check **External Python Examples** in CLAUDE.md for example strategies. Think step by step.
